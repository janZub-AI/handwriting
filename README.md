####Keras tuner
Great way to try out many different numbers/sizes of layers and hyperparameters.

####HyperModel
Model that should be "valid" with a little bit of tuning for small-sized grayscale datasets.

###Tensorboard
Added manager to change guided trials into more parameter-dependent and verbose.
